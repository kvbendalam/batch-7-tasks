        <h4>How computer memory works</h4>

        <p>A computer is a device that is electronic and that accepts data, processes that data, and gives the desired output. It performs programmed computation with great accuracy & higher speed. Or in other words, the computer takes data as input and stores the data/instructions in the memory (use them when required). It then processes the data and converts it into useful information. Finally, it gives the output. Here, input refers to the raw data that we want the machine to process and return to us as a result, output refers to the response that the machine provides in response to the raw data entered and the processing of data may involve analyzing, searching, distributing, storing data, etc. Thus, we can also call a computer data processing system.</p>
    
        <p>Computer memory is just like the human brain. It is used to store data/information and instructions. It is a data storage unit or a data storage device where data is to be processed and instructions required for processing are stored. It can store both the input and output can be stored here.</p>

        <h4>Characteristics of Main Memory:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>It is faster computer memory as compare to secondary memory.</li>
            <li>It is semiconductor memories.</li>
            <li>It is usually a volatile memory.</li>
            <li>It is the main memory of the computer.</li>
            <li>A computer system cannot run without primary memory.</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Primary Memory:</li>
                <p>It is also known as the main memory of the computer system. It is used to store data and programs or instructions during computer operations. It uses semiconductor technology and hence is commonly called semiconductor memory. Primary memory is of two types:</p>
            <li>Secondary Memory:</li>
                <p>It is also known as auxiliary memory and backup memory. It is a non-volatile memory and used to store a large amount of data or information. The data or information stored in secondary memory is permanent, and it is slower than primary memory. A CPU cannot access secondary memory directly. The data/information from the auxiliary memory is first transferred to the main memory, and then the CPU can access it.</p>
